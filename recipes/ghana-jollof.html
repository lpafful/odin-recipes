        <div class="main"><h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Originally from Senegal, Jollof is a pot dish of rice prepared 
            with tomato sauce and served with meat or fish that stirs up 
            plenty of interesting debate online.The rice soaks up the juicy 
            flavours and turns orange when cooking, and is a national favourite 
            that can be found in most restaurants or dished out by street vendors 
            at affordable prices.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Rice</strong> – The starchy base for our dish, this filling ingredient is generally fragrant and soaks a lot of water</li>
              <li><strong>Onions</strong> – This veggie is excellent served fresh with its tangy flavor.</li>
              <li><strong>Thyme</strong> – A deliciously aromatic herb from the incredible mint family is a delicious addition to just about any savory recipe</li>
              <li><strong>Garlic</strong> – Ah, the wonderful garlic flavor makes this Jollof Rice recipe even better</li>
              <li><strong>Paprika</strong> – This ingredient adds the fabulous pepper flavor without the heat.</li>
              <li><strong>Tomato Puree or Sauce</strong> – The sweet, slightly acidic, and fresh flavors of tomato in a thick mixture is perfect for many starchy dishes.</li>
              <li><strong>Chicken Broth (or water)</strong> – Basically, the flavorful water that chicken was simmered in</li>
              <li><strong>Scotch Bonnet or Hot Pepper</strong> – My favorite hot pepper is a tear-jerker, but sometimes a good cry is good for ya.</li>
              <li><strong>Vegetables</strong> – Carrots, peas, green beans, and corn are all excellent choices to create a mix of colorful veggies to make it even more vibrant. </li>
             </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                 <li><p>Prepare the rice and the oven – Preheat oven to 350℉/177℃. Rinse the rice with water and drain.</p>
                     <p>Combine and Stir – In a half-sheet pan (approx. 13″x18″x 2½”), combine all ingredients and stir so that everything is fully incorporated.</p></li>
                 <li><p>Cover and Cook – Cover tightly with aluminum foil paper. Double the foil if you can because it helps cook faster. </p>
                    <p>Gently place in the oven and cook for about 70-80 minutes. Carefully remove from the oven and check after 70 minutes. Since posting, </p>
                    <p>I have retried the recipe several times, and it works best for my oven after 75 minutes.</p></li>
                 <li><p>Open and Serve – When cooked, remove carefully from the oven and let it rest for about 5 minutes. </p>
                    <p>Then carefully remove the aluminum paper. Fluff rice with a fork, throw in your add-ins, and mix evenly. </p>
                    <p>Serve hot, but you can let it cool a tad if you prefer.</p></li>
                </ol>
