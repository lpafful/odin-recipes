        <li>optional okra</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender, purée 2 onion halves, 1/2 cup (120ml) chicken stock, 3 garlic cloves, 1/2 ounce ginger, and tomato paste.</li> 
        <li>In a Dutch oven, combine chicken legs with purée, remaining onion halves, remaining 1/2 ounce ginger, and remaining 2 cloves garlic, along with hot pepper and bay leaves. Toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Set Dutch oven over medium heat and bring to a simmer, then cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until halved onion is soft and translucent, 
            about 20 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Add an extra 1/2 cup (120ml) chicken stock if mixture begins to stick to the bottom of the pot</li>
        <li>Transfer chunks of onion, ginger, garlic cloves, and hot pepper to blender. </li>
        <li>Add peanut butter, canned tomatoes and their juices, and remaining 1 1/2 cups (360ml) chicken stock and purée until smooth.</li>
        <li> Pass blended mix through a fine-mesh strainer into the Dutch oven, stirring to incorporate. </li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium and bring to a simmer, then lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is tender, oils have surfaced, and mixture has thickened and reduced by about one-third, about 40 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Add smoked fish, reduce heat to low, cover pot, and cook an additional 5 minutes. (If omitting the smoked fish, you can skip this 5-minute covered-cooking step.)</li> 
        <li>Remove and discard smoked fish and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve hot over white rice or fufu.</li>
